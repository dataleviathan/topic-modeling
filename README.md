This project applies topic modeling techniques to book descriptions scraped from the "Books to Scrape" website. It demonstrates the full pipeline of web scraping, text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and topic modeling using TF-IDF with KMeans, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Top2Vec. Each method offers different insights into the underlying themes of the dataset, despite data quality limitations from the fictitious source. Visualizations and clustering outputs help reveal structure in the text, offering potential applications in content categorization, curriculum design, and recommendation systems.
